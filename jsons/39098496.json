{"title": "Ozone Preserves Cheesey Aroma with No Harm", "body": "The preservation of aged cheeses is a complex task, as they are highly susceptible to spoilage microflora and contamination. The Toma Piemontese PDO cheese, a traditional Italian cheese, is particularly vulnerable to degradation due to its high moisture content and specific aging process. Therefore, finding effective methods to control spoilage and preserve the quality of this cheese is crucial for maintaining its distinctive characteristics and extending its shelf life. A recent study aimed to explore the efficacy of low gaseous ozone concentrations in controlling spoilage microflora and preserving the quality of the aged Toma Piemontese PDO cheese. The research involved a multi-approach analysis, combining consumer tests, Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) with Solid phase Microextraction (SPME) fiber, and Electronic Nose (e-nose) analysis. Specifically, the study included GC-FID analysis to quantify 22 compounds, and a 12-sensor Quartz Microbalance (QMB) e-nose to identify subtle differences in aroma. The ozone treatments were applied at concentrations of 300 ppb and 400 ppb, and the samples were compared to untreated controls. The results indicated that low ozone concentrations significantly affected spoilage microflora, preserving the overall quality of the aged Toma Piemontese PDO cheese. The GC-FID analysis showed that ozone treatments maintained the distinctive characteristics of the cheese, reducing the formation of off-flavors-related compounds, such as ethanol. Moreover, the ozone-treated samples correlated with positive aroma scores given by consumers. The advanced approaches, including the 12-sensor QMB e-nose, played a crucial role in identifying subtle differences in aroma, contributing to a more nuanced understanding of ozone treatments on the cheese's sensory profile. This research demonstrates the potential of ozone technology as a viable and effective method for improving the quality of aged Toma Piemontese PDO cheese. The study highlights the importance of advanced approaches, such as GC-MS, SPME, and e-nose analysis, in understanding the complex interactions among aroma compounds and the effects of ozone treatments on the cheese's sensory profile. The findings of this study can contribute to the development of new preservation methods for aged cheeses, ensuring their quality and extending their shelf life.", "images_prompts": ["Toma cheese, natural lighting, depth of field, high resolution, cinematic, ", "Italy Piedmont, natural lighting, depth of field, high resolution, cinematic, ", "Cheese, natural lighting, depth of field, high resolution, cinematic, ", "Italy, natural lighting, depth of field, high resolution, cinematic, "]}
