{"title": "Ozone and Water Cleaning with Tiny Bubbles", "body": "The treatment of contaminated water is a pressing issue worldwide. Conventional water treatment methods can be time-consuming and often introduce secondary pollutants, posing risks to both the environment and human health. Micro and nanobubbles (MNBs) have emerged as a promising solution, offering a convenient and efficient method for water treatment. Composed of gas and water, MNBs avoid the introduction of potential secondary pollutants, making them an attractive option. This study aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of MNBs-assisted advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) in water treatment, shedding light on their potential applications and limitations. To investigate the characteristics and mechanisms of MNBs-assisted AOPs, researchers employed a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches. The study focused on four types of AOPs: ozone, plasma, photocatalytic, and Fenton oxidation. The researchers evaluated the performance of MNBs in enhancing pollutant removal efficiency, improving the utilization of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and reducing energy consumption. The electrical energy per order of reaction (EE/O) parameter was calculated to assess the energy efficiency of each MNBs-assisted AOP. The study revealed that MNBs can significantly enhance pollutant removal efficiency by promoting interface reactions between ROS and pollutants. The results showed that MNBs-assisted AOPs can achieve higher removal rates compared to traditional AOPs. Furthermore, the calculation of the EE/O parameter indicated that MNBs can reduce total energy consumption in most tested cases, making them a more energy-efficient option. The study also highlighted the importance of understanding the mechanisms of MNBs-assisted AOPs in optimizing their performance and efficiency. This critical review provides a comprehensive overview of the fundamental mechanisms of MNBs-assisted AOPs in water treatment. The results demonstrate the potential of MNBs in enhancing pollutant removal efficiency and reducing energy consumption. The study's findings are anticipated to facilitate an in-depth understanding of the mechanisms of MNBs-assisted AOPs, guiding the development of MNBs-based technologies for water treatment. Future research opportunities are proposed to further explore the potential applications and limitations of MNBs-assisted AOPs, ultimately contributing to the development of more efficient and sustainable water treatment methods.", "images_prompts": ["A microscopic view of a microbubble bursting with water droplets and a burst of reactive oxygen species in the background, illustrating the mechanism of MNBs-assisted AOPs.", "A nanobubble trapped in a photocatalytic surface with a pollutant molecule being oxidized, highlighting the role of MNBs in enhancing ROS utilization.", "A schematic diagram of different MNBs-assisted AOPs, including ozone, plasma, photocatalytic, and Fenton oxidation, with MNBs facilitating interface reactions and pollutant removal efficiency.", "A futuristic laboratory setup with a researcher operating a device that generates MNBs-assisted AOPs, with a cityscape in the background representing the potential application of MNBs-based technologies in water treatment."]}
