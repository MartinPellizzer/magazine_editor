{"title": "Ozone Treatment for Safe Drinking Water Reuse", "body": "Water scarcity is a growing concern worldwide, and the use of reclaimed water has become increasingly important as a sustainable solution. However, reclaimed water poses environmental and human health risks due to residual organic micropollutants and pathogens. Ozonation, a common method used in water treatment, is crucial in controlling pathogens and trace organics in reclaimed water. However, achieving efficient pathogen reduction while minimizing the formation of disinfection byproducts remains a significant challenge. This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of ozonation in removing pathogens and minimizing the formation of disinfection byproducts in reclaimed water. In this pilot-scale study, a plug flow reactor (PFR) was used to test three different ozone doses (0.7, 1.0, and 1.4 ozone/total organic carbon (O3/TOC) ratio) on actual reclaimed water. The disinfection efficiency was assessed by measuring the presence of various pathogens, including total coliforms, Escherichia Coli (E. coli), Pepper Mild Mottle Virus (PMMoV), Tomato Brown Rugose Fruit Virus (ToBRFV), and Norovirus (HNoV). The ozone contact time (CT) values ranged from 1.60 to 13.62 mg.min L-1. The results of the study showed that ozonation was effective in reducing the concentrations of pathogens and indicators in the reclaimed water. The concentration reductions ranged from 2.46-2.89 log for total coliforms, 2.03-2.18 log for E. coli, 0.46-1.63 log for PMMoV, 2.23-2.64 log for ToBRFV, and >4 log for HNoV. However, the formation of disinfection byproducts, such as bromate and N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), was also observed. The concentrations of bromate and NDMA increased after ozonation, reaching levels between 2.8 -12.0 \u03bcg L-1 and 28 - 40.0 ng L-1, respectively. The study demonstrates that ozonation can be an effective method for removing pathogens from reclaimed water. However, the formation of disinfection byproducts, such as bromate and NDMA, is a concern. To implement ozonation in reclaimed water reuse applications, it is essential to ensure efficient pathogen reduction while minimizing the formation of disinfection byproducts. The findings of this study can help inform the development of advanced water treatment systems for potable reuse of reclaimed water.", "images_prompts": ["ozonation, natural lighting, depth of field, high resolution, cinematic, ", "pathogen removal, natural lighting, depth of field, high resolution, cinematic, ", "water treatment, natural lighting, depth of field, high resolution, cinematic, ", "disinfection, natural lighting, depth of field, high resolution, cinematic, "]}
