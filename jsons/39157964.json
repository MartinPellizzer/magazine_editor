{"title": "Ozonation Boosts Wastewater Degradation Efficiency", "body": "Water pollution is a growing concern worldwide, with the discharge of dye-containing wastewater posing serious ecological risks. Conventional wastewater treatment methods often have shortcomings, such as incomplete degradation, long treatment times, and secondary pollution. Therefore, developing new and efficient methods to degrade pollutants is crucial to protect our environment. A recent study aimed to address this issue by designing a rotational hydrodynamic cavitation reactor (RHCR) equipped with a conical rotor to enhance the ozonation process for effective degradation of pollutants. This innovative approach has the potential to revolutionize wastewater treatment and provide a more sustainable solution for the environment. The study involved investigating the effects of various parameters on the degradation of methylene blue (MB), a common dye pollutant. The parameters studied included rotational speed, discharge voltage, gas flow rate, liquid flow rate, and initial pH. The RHCR was designed to integrate ozonation and cavitation, and the optimised conditions were determined to be initial pH = 9, rotational speed = 1800 rpm, discharge voltage = 9.3 kV, gas flow rate = 60 mL/min, and liquid flow rate = 80 mL/min. The MB degradation efficiency was then evaluated under these optimised conditions. The results of the study showed that the integration of ozonation and cavitation in RHCR significantly improved the MB degradation efficiency, reaching 95.2%. This was 15.6% higher than that of the individual ozonation method. The degradation process was found to follow the first-order kinetic model, with a reaction rate and synergy index of 0.232 min^-1 and 1.78, respectively. Quenching experiments confirmed that the contribution proportion of hydroxyl radical during degradation was increased by 8.7% due to the enhancement of cavitation. The energy consumption of the RHCR was also calculated to be 74.7 kWh/order/m^3, which is approximately 80% lower than that of a recently reported degradation system combining ozonation and cavitation. The findings of this study provide a new water treatment method and offer theoretical references for the design of RHCR. The integration of ozonation and cavitation in RHCR has been proven to be an effective and efficient approach for degrading pollutants. The optimised conditions determined in this study can be used to design and operate RHCR for wastewater treatment, reducing energy consumption and total expense. This innovative approach has the potential to revolutionize wastewater treatment and provide a more sustainable solution for the environment."}
