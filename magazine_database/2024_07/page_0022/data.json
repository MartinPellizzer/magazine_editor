    "study_abstract": "In recent decades, the rise in volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emissions has posed significant environmental and health challenges. The present work focuses on CH4, a highly stable alkane VOC and the second most abundant anthropogenic greenhouse gas after CO2. Ozone-assisted Catalytic Oxidation (OzCO) is recognized as a promising method for VOC elimination, particularly effective at lower temperatures. Generally, MnOx materials have exhibited high activity in OzCO, attributed to its pronounced reducibility, multiple oxidation states and superior performance in O3 decomposition. The addition of a second transition metal has been explored to enhance the MnOx performance. Cu-Mn bimetallic oxides stand out as a favorable option in this respect, offering both low cost and high activity [1]. However, the impact of Cu addition on the ultimate properties of Cu-Mn bimetallic catalysts, such as redox and O2 desorption characteristics, and how these factors affect the catalytic performance, require further exploration to fully understand and optimize their efficiency in VOC elimination.",
