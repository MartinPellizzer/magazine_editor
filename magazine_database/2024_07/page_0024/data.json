    "study_abstract": "The aim of this work is to develop a biodegradable planting container based on a wood-polymer composite made from polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) and modified wood flour. To obtain a product with a given biodegradation rate, a filler is introduced into the polymer matrix in a ratio that provides the required mechanical strength. In the work were conducted experimental studies to determine the tensile strength and bending strength, impact toughness and a study to determine the rate of biodegradation of samples. The results of the studies showed that preliminary ozonization of wood flour allows to introduce into the composite up to 50% of wood filler from the total mass of the composition without loss of its mechanical properties.",
